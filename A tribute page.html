<p> <b>Sushant Singh Rajput</b> (21 January 1986 – 14 June 2020) was an Indian actor who is best known for his work in Hindi cinema.
He starred in a number of commercially successful Bollywood films such as M.S. Dhoni: The 
Untold Story (2016), Kedarnath (2018) and Chhichhore (2019). Due to his contribution to the film industry, he received a Screen Award and was 
nominated for the Filmfare Awards on two occasions.
On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling fan[179] in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.[180] He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and was suffering from bipolar disorder.[181][182][183] The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, 
stating that the death was being treated as a suicide.[184] The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"[185] 
and called it a "clear case of suicide."[186] The autopsy doctors placed time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June 
at 11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time).[187] No foul play was found.[188] The viscera report likewise ruled 
out foul play.[189] On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing 
<b>Rhea Chakraborty</b> and five others of abetment of suicide.[190]</p>
